1) How is multitenancy setup currently to distribute handling of clients (e.g. is unicorn used somehow by the docker container?)
## the next questions deal with what appears to be called hybrid search (e.g. https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/hybrid-search-fastembed/)
2) Sparse vector representation appears to be an option, and qdrant seems to suggest that's how traditional searches work. Double check this against the current code which appears to be simply a "match word" query
3) More generally, implement multiple vector search options (multiple columns)...(do we need multiple vector configs then in the create_collection?)
4) Note - using fastembed during specification of the collection appears to allow more dynamic/flexibility in defining the models through fastembed later.  However, does this approach allow multiple vector embedding columns?
    As far as I can tell, just specify a dictionary for the vector embeddings upon create_collection:  https://gist.github.com/kacperlukawski/961aaa7946f55110abfcd37fbe869b8f
5) Need the docker container (and website) to restart upon shutdown (or restart of computer)
